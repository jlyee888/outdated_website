          <h1>About this site...</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to my outdoor adventures website! I made this website
            because I wanted to find a creative way to post about my outings in
            order to inspire others to enjoy the outdoors as well. This website
            not only features a series of blog posts (located in my hike-log
            link) but can also serve as a helpful tool for those that are
            looking forward to plan their own trip in SoCal. Thus, under each
            regional area tab, one can find hike/backpacking planning resources
            to make their next trip a success!
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continue to get better at website making, newer features will
            streamline your hike-planning process so stay tuned!

          <p>
            I'm a SoCal native that loves being in the outdoors. As a Boy Scout,
            my first "real" experience in the outdoors was an eye-opening 5-day
            trek in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico's Philmont
            Scout Ranch. Since then, I've enjoyed the solitude, challenge, and
            mental comfort of being in the great outdoors.

            23 Sept. 2020. Thoughts and prayers go out to the firefighters and
            those affected by the Bobcat and El Dorado Fires. As of the last
            update, the SoCal National Forests are still closed to the public
            because of firefighting efforts.

            On Aug 28-29, my dad, brother, and I went on a backpacking trip to
            San Jacinto NF. We took South Ridge trail up to Tahquitz Peak and
            it's famous fire-lookout. Read more about it <a href="#">here</a>.
